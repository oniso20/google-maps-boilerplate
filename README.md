# Google Maps Boilerplate

This mini project is used as a boilerplate for finding locations using ´Typescript´ and `Google map`

# Steps to follow

1. `npm install` (to install webpack and other dependencies)
2. `npm start` (to start the webpack)
3. You can check the `localhost:9000`

It's free to use, but ensure to add you your google map `API_KEY` to the `index.html` and `app.ts` file.
